            <h3>Tip 1</h3>
            <h4>1. GREEN ENERGY</h4>
            <p>
              There has never been a better time to switch to 100% renewable energy! Prices are low and the planet will be much happier and healthier for it. To see how much you could save, for your organisation and the environment, try the Big Clean Switch today.Green energy is any energy type that is generated from natural resources, such as sunlight, wind or water. It often comes from renewable energy sources although there are some differences between renewable and green energy.As a source of energy, green energy often comes from renewable energy technologies such as solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy, biomass and hydroelectric power. Each of these technologies works in different ways, whether that is by taking power from the sun, as with solar panels, or using wind turbines or the flow of water to generate energy.</p>

            <h3>Tip 2</h3>
            <h4>2.OFFSET YOUR CARBON CAREFULLY
            </h4>
            <p>Heading for net zero is encouraging more businesses to consider how to reduce their carbon footprint. Offsetting seems like a quick win to achieve this. However, offsets should always be the absolute last resort in a hierarchy of prevention, reduction, investment, offsetting. Prevent emissions by reducing the number of trips taken, reduce emissions by saving energy or taking lower carbon options for trips, and invest in your own renewable energy (can you install solar panels, can you connect to a local renewable energy source). If you are looking to offset, we use Gold Standard certified projects. These provide long-term carbon reduction solutions, demonstrate environmental integrity and contribute to sustainable development. A useful guide to offsetting can be found here.

            <h3>Tip 3</h3>
            <h4>3. SET REDUCTION TARGETS</h4>
            <p>Once we know the size of our footprint, we can reduce it. Look at your average annual footprint, then set targets to reduce it. You could start small with a goal of reducing travel emissions by 5% over the next 3 years. You can also set targets that aren’t emissions-based, such as reducing energy or water use by 2% a year. Set ambitious but achievable targets and report against these publicly on your website. This shows dedication to the environment, responsibility for your impacts, and that you’re willing to be held accountable to your stakeholders. To take it further, set a Science-Based Target, a public commitment to reduce your emissions in-line with a 1.5oC level of global warming.</p>
